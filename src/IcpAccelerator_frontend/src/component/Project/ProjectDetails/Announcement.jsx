            The Student Side Dashboard provides students with access to the
            assigned tests and assessments created by their respective teachers.
            Students can log in to their accounts, view a list of available
            tests, and choose the tests they want to attempt. The dashboard
            allows them to navigate through the tests, answer questions, and
            submit their responses within the specified time limit. Upon
            completing a test, students can view their scores and performance
            summary. The platform provides immediate feedback, highlighting
            correct and incorrect answers, helping students identify areas that
            require improvement. They can also access their historical test
            results and track their progress over time.
