The combined efforts of Lugano, Dfinity and supporting actors such as SUPSI (the University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Lugano) and ICPHub are sure to make this a highly successful incubator. The program extends over a period of 6 months and is segmented into sprints, as detailed below. Each project is paired with a mentor to offer guidance throughout the incubation process. To ensure a top-notch incubation experience, there are two in-person workshops monthly, complemented by a weekly remote mentoring session for each project. Teams consisting of two or more members are invited to apply, with a focus on building or planning to build solutions that leverage the Internet Computer Protocol for their computing requirements. The solutions must also be of entrepreneurial interest and foresee real world application within revenue-generating businesses that would be interesting to external funding sources. Finally, if selected for advancement through the incubator rounds, the founders must be willing to found a company in Lugano to operate the solution. Funding required for the establishment of a company is provided for qualifying participants. Unleash the power of your project with a substantial allocation of ICP tokens, reaching up to USD 85,000 per selected project. The funds will be dispersed in stages with USD 10’000 granted upon selection and enrollment, USD 25’000 at the presentation of an MVP (minimum viable product), and the balance subject to approval by the selection committee.",
